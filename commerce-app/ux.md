Your objective is to create a front-end for an E-Commerce application using React, with any theme of your choosing (E.g. book store, video game store, etc.). The app will show you a list of items for sale, and allow the user to add them to a shopping basket, which shows the total price of all the items in the basket. You can go beyond this scope if you wish, e.g. having different categories of items.

Your application must have a quality User Experience design. Create a UX document where you will:

- Perform a simple competitor analysis
- Generate user problem statements and convert them to how we might statements
- Generate potential colour schemes with considerations for target audience and sector
